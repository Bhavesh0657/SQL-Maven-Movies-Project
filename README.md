# SQL-Maven-Movies-Project
In this project, I have utilized the Maven movie dataset to perform various SQL queries and analysis to derive valuable insights. Below are some of the questions I've tackled:

# Movies Rented More Than 30 Times: 
Find the titles of movies, excluding those starting with 'A', that have been rented more than 30 times. Sort them in descending order.
# Total Revenue by Store: 
Calculate the total revenue generated by Store1.
## Horror Movies Sorting:
Retrieve titles of movies in the 'Horror' category, sorted based on the last character of the title.
## Top Customers: 
Fetch the top 5 customers whose names start with 'E' and have made the highest number of rentals. Display their customer IDs and the total number of rentals they have made.
## Film Count by Category: 
Determine the total number of films available in each category and list the categories in descending order of film count.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Maven movie dataset, which contains information about movies, customers, rentals, and more.
