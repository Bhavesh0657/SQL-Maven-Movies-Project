# SQL-Maven-Movies-Project
In this project, I have utilized the Maven movie dataset to perform various SQL queries and analysis to derive valuable insights. Below are some of the questions I've tackled:

1. Movies Rented More Than 30 Times: Find the titles of movies, excluding those starting with 'A', that have been rented more than 30 times. Sort them in descending order.
2. Total Revenue by Store: Calculate the total revenue generated by Store1.
3. Horror Movies Sorting: Retrieve titles of movies in the 'Horror' category, sorted based on the last character of the title.
4. Top Customers: Fetch the top 5 customers whose names start with 'E' and have made the highest number of rentals. Display their customer IDs and the total number of rentals they have made.
5. Film Count by Category: Determine the total number of films available in each category and list the categories in descending order of film count.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Maven movie dataset, which contains information about movies, customers, rentals, and more.
